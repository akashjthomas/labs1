Peloneustes is a genus of pliosaurid plesiosaur from the Middle Jurassic of England, known from the Oxford Clay Formation.
 Its sole species was originally named Plesiosaurus philarchus by Harry Govier Seeley 
 in 1869 before Richard Lydekker gave it its own genus in 1889.
 It is known from many specimens, some very complete. 
 It had a total length of 3.5 to 4 metres (11 to 13 ft), 
 and a large, triangular skull elongated into a narrow snout with conical teeth.
